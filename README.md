<B> PA1 - Edge Detection and Histogram Equalization </B><br>
Problem 1 : 1D and 2D Convolution on Images - Sobel filters are convolved on images to detect vertical and horizontal edges in images.<br><br>
Problem 2 : Histogram Equalization - It is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast.<br><br><br>

<B> PA2 - Stereo Vision, View Synthesis and Mean Shift Segmentation </B><br>
Problem 1 : Stereo Vision -> Given left and right view of same scene, estimate disparities using basic block matching and dynamic                     programming. Check its consistency against given ground truth disparities of the two views.<br><br>
Problem 2 : View Synthesis -> Given two views - left and right of the same scene, estimate the third(middle) view of the scene using the               two views and their ground truth disparities.<br><br>
Problem 3 : Mean Shift Segmentation -> To perform mean shift segmentation on the given image.
